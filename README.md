# 🧠 DSA Practice – Multi-language (C, Java, Python, JavaScript)

This repository is a collection of data structure and algorithm solutions organized by topic and implemented in multiple languages. My goal is to deepen my problem-solving skills, prepare for technical interviews, and showcase cross-language fluency.

## 🔍 Structure

- `by-topic/` — Solutions grouped by topic (arrays, strings, trees, etc.), each with implementations in multiple languages.
- `by-language/` — (Coming soon) Language-focused folders for recruiters and role-specific skills.
- `challenges/` — Platform-specific solutions from LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.

## ✅ Languages Used
- C
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript

## 📚 Topics (in progress)
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Recursion
- Sorting & Searching
- Dynamic Programming
